 # Duck's Web Dev Portfolio #

 > Tried to keep this site true to my personal brand. I wanted to keep the UI consise, like Hemingway... with a touch of goof.

## Final Thoughts: ## 

> I used Nodemailer for the contact form. Next time I might experiment with other alternatives (If you're reading this, what do you like to use for contact forms? Is there something you've found to be a breeze to work with?)

> Some folks might scoff at the fact that I hardcoded the data that I use for my Projects component. I won't say you're wrong for having that thought. I could have pulled the data from a JSON file and mapped over it, but for this project I thought that to be over complicating it. As I add more projects to my portfolio I will reassess and determine what makes the most sense then.

> I had a lot of fun trying to keep the UI responsive on different devices. If this site is not responsive on your device, please inform me so I can update the design. I have done as much as I can with DevTools and demoing on my own personal devices, but I don't want to miss anything.

> I deployed the server for nodemailer on Heroku.
